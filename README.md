# Telegram-bot

![Hireable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hireable-yes-success) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Microverse%20projects-blueviolet)

> In this project, I built a Telegram Bot that can search the IMDB domains for random movies that will show you a title and the movie ranking on the IMDB page. It also sends you random funny random jokes every time you type in the command /joke. The main goal is to make a massive use of external API`s by putting into practice the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming, classes, modules, objects and accessing their attributes.<br>
> The project is built using the TDD technique.

## You can see a short demo of the Bot /start command in the screenshot below.
